        <h2>About Healthkard</h2>
        <p>
          Healthkard has a clear objective: to provide hassle-free access to
          physical doctor consultations. Our main agenda is to create a single
          card called Healthkard, that allows people to visit multiple doctors
          associated with us and multiple times for just INR 99.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user will receive a unique Healthkard ID, which securely
          identifies personal details, preventing any misuse of the card. We are
          committed to making healthcare affordable and accessible to all by
          setting a fixed price of INR 99 for physical doctor consultations.
          This way, we remove financial barriers and ensure that everyone can
          receive the care they need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Healthkard also encourages regular check-ups and preventive care. Our
          goal is to revolutionize the way people approach healthcare by
          providing a convenient and cost-effective solution. We want to empower
          individuals to prioritize their health and seek timely medical advice.
          So, if you need to visit a doctor in our country, weâ€™re here to
          provide you with Healthkard.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you for trusting us with your health. We look forward to serving
          you!
